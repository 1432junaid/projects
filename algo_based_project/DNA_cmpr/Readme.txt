this project is use to campare the DNA of two or more different organism.
A strand of DNA consists of a string of molecules called bases,where the possible base are:
* adenine
* guanine
* cytosine 
* thymine.
In this project we can express a strand of DNA as a string over the finite set = {A,G,C,T}

we are finding the longest common sub-sequence by implementing the LCS algo /.

working :

input :	
user can input 2 different stirngs 
like , S1 ={A,G,T,C,A,C,T}
	S2 ={A,C,G,C,A,G,T,C}

output :
S3 = 4
